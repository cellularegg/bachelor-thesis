\section{Introduction}\label{section:introduction}
With the growing popularity of Internet of Things (\ac{IoT}) and digitizing business processes there is a growing amount of data available for analysis.
In order to utilize the data from the IoT sensors it needs to be preprocessed. One step of preprocessing is data cleaning (also referred as data cleansing).
The main goal of data cleansing is to increase the data quality and furthermore to detect and remove anomalies in the data. The quality requirements for the data can differ depending on the use case. Anomalies in sensor data are datapoints which do not picture the reality. For example an anomaly of a temperature sensor would be if the sensor reads 0 $^{\circ}$C and the real temperature is 23 $^{\circ}$C.

\section{Research Question}
What are common methods to detect outliers for time series data? \newline
How can outlier detection methods be compared, with a focus on water level data? \newline
Based on water levels from different rivers, which method is able to classify outliers most reliably?

\section{Research Method}
This paper is a literature research. To get an overview of the topic, papers related to: data cleaning, anomaly detection for IoT data / time series data and outlier detection methods were researched. After some base knowledge was established the major topics of the paper were defined. Subsequently more research was done on the major topics (Features of data quality, data cleaning \& cleansing, outlier detection). To organize the references found while researching Zotero was used, with the Add-on Better BibTeX. \todo{Adapt research method}
